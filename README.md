# My-First-Project-
This is a  coursework on Introduction of Information System. We were tasked with 
creating a website for a bonsai shop selling and providing many services. In this 
coursework, everyone was assigned with a position and a part to complete individually 
which was overseen by the group leader. On this website, we were tasked with creating 
many different types of pages to challenge the knowledge we acquired and the 
capability to learn individually.
On this website, there are many different types of web pages. The 
main ones are the home and product pages as they are essential to a website for a 
shop. Among them are some webpages to provide information such as blogs and about 
us and also a separate webpage to contact us and ask for assistance. 



The main goal of this group coursework was to develop a functional e-commerce 
website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project gave us an opportunity to apply 
the knowledge and skills we had acquired through our coursework, as well as to 
conduct independent research to expand our understanding of web development.
One of the main objectives of this project was to learn how to work as a group and coordinate effectively. Through this project, we aimed to develop our communication skills 
and learn how to delegate tasks based on the strengths and skills of each team 
member. We also sought to increase our overall productivity and improve the quality of 
our work by working together as a team.
Individually, our objective was to deepen our understanding of web development and 
improve our technical skills. We also aimed to learn the importance of time 
management and how to prioritize tasks efficiently to complete the work within the 
limited time frame. Additionally, we sought to grow as programmers and individuals 
through this project.
